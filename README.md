## Course Description

It is a fast-paced **level 11** postgraduate course starting from C#/.NET basics and quickly moving to more advanced object-oriented concepts and applications spanning numerical methods, computational mathematics and quantitative finance. 

While it's an assignment-only course, the workload is quite heavy and every year a few students fail this course. You will need to make sure you work through the tutorial sheets and lecture material regularly to clear-up any doubts as they come up and make the most of the teaching staff's help before heading off to work on the main project during the winter teaching vacation.

Computers are provided in the lab.

## Prerequisites / Warning 
* At least one semester of an undergraduate course dedicated to programming (in any language). Understanding of flow control, methods/functions and some basics of data structures. This requirement is for both UG students and PGT students from MSc programmes other than MSc Computational Mathematical Finance.

* This must **not be** your first programming course.  You should have done at least one semester of programming (using Matlab or R to draw some graphs doesn’t count).

* This course is demanding as:
  * you need to know computational mathematics (nonlinear solvers, numerical integration, Monte-Carlo, finite difference PDE solvers, optimization), it is **assumed** that you know mostof this from your undergraduate studies
  * you need to know or like mathematical finance & derivative pricing 
  * you need to learn a new programming language – C#
  * you will need to a lot of time to work through the assignments

* Consider [Python Programmin](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxmath11199.htm) or [Scientific Computing](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxmath11198.htm) for a course at a slower pace

## Learning outcomes
* It is intended that students will demonstrate:
